# 🛰️ Mr. Z — Data • Code • Curiosity

**Engineer · Data Analyst · Builder of odd beautiful things**

I explore the space where **data meets imagination** — from Python analytics and LLM automation  
to Node.js servers, Raspberry Pi prototypes, and creative AI tools.

## 🔧 Tech Focus
- 📊 Data Analysis & Visualization → Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib), SQL  
- 🤖 AI & Automation → local LLMs (Ollama, DeepSeek, Mistral), QA copilots, data agents  
- 🧱 Engineering → WebRTC chat apps, custom keyboard extensions, IoT builds  
- 🎨 Creative Projects → VSYO Studio | UniqOdd | Tribrata Stroy
